### Changes and possible improvement

The code is a lot cleaner now â€” meeting processing works, pagination, retries, and retry logic are all in helper functions, so `worker.js` is way easier to read.

HubSpot API stuff is still mixed into the `worker.js` and  should be move it to its own service module for better separation and easier testing. (testing is another thing, but I hope in production ready code it would have full testing suite unit/it/e2e)

To improve performance we could switch to HubSpot's GraphQL API, which is more efficient for fetching related data like contacts and associations. This will reduce the number of API calls and network latency.

Caching contacts and associations would also help reduce redundant requests.

We could add more context to the logs (like which batch or entity failed), prepare structured logging so it can be easily integrated with some logging service like ELK, Datadog, sumologic etc, and start tracking real metrics (batch sizes, API times, error rates)

The retry logic is fine for now, but if is not a scheduled job we should add jitter or a circuit breaker to avoid overwhelming the HubSpot API with retries.

The `saveDomain` function is a stub, if enabled watch out for DB write frequency and maybe use cqrs and dedicated db service to handle writes separately.

During implementation I fixed some small bugs (like the wrong filter operator (GTQ instead of GTE) and null filtering. Queue concurrency is still odd (1000000) and it needs review or load-test to make sure it performs well.
